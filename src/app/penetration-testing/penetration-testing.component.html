  <h2>What is a Penetration Test?</h2>
  <p>
    On average about 2,200 attacks happen a day. Hackers try their luck at any system they can get their hands on.
    From Malware, to phishing, to DDoS, to DNS Tunneling, the options are endless. In order to protect your data,
    you have to put your own systems to the test regularly, ensuring they are strong enough to withstand hackers.
    It is important not only to be one step ahead but many steps.

  <h2>Types of Penetration Tests</h2>
  <div class="types-content">
    <div class="type-box">
      <h3>Black Box Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Black Box Testing involves testing a system with no prior knowledge of its internal workings. A tester provides an input, and observes the output generated by the system under test. This makes it possible to identify how the system responds to expected and unexpected user actions, its response time, usability issues, and reliability issues.
      </p>

    <div class="type-box">
      <h3>White Box Testing</h3>
      <p>
        White Box Testing is a method where the internal workings of an application, as well as its code and architecture, are known to the tester. The goal is to identify the most effective and thorough ways to test the system.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="type-box">
      <h3>Gray Box Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Gray Box Testing is a mix of Black and White Box Testing, providing limited knowledge to the tester about the system being tested. This type of testing balances the benefits of both methods.
